# Exercise 4: Analyzing Campaign Performance in Power BI

With the wide spectrum of data sources and Litware's data in OneLake, it is now time to get some awesome insights and visualizations from this data. Let's dive deep into the experience of the Business Analyst, Wendy, and do just that.

## Task 3.1: Create a Semantic model and generate insights using Copilot for Power BI

Based on all the gathered data, Wendy is expected to create Power BI reports for other data citizens and stakeholders. Let's step into her shoes to experience the power of Copilot for Power BI in conjunction with Direct Lake Mode.

1. In your browser, navigate back to the Microsoft Fabric Tab.

2. Select **Workspaces** and select the **ZavaWorkspace_@lab.LabInstance.Id** workspace. Choose and select the **ZavaLakehouse** lakehouse item.

3. In the **ZavaLakehouse** lakehouse view, select **New semantic model**.

7. On the left navigation pane, select your **website_bounce_rate_model** semantic model to view its details. 

8. In the **website_bounce_rate_model** semantic model view, select **File** then **Create a new report** to create a new report using the model.

9. Select the **Copilot** icon from the top menu bar to open the Copilot pane. For better room in the report canvas, collapse the **Filters**, **Visualizations**, and **Data** panes.

10. In the Copilot pane, toggle the **Preview** switch on then select **Get Started**.

    You will now see how easy it is for the data analyst to create compelling Power BI reports and get deep insights with literally no hands-on coding!

11. Using the chat interface in the **Copilot pane**, enter this following prompt `What's in my data?` and observe how Copilot provides an overview of the contents of the dataset.

12. Using the chat interface in the **Copilot pane**, enter this following prompt `Create a detailed page to analyze the Website Bounce Rate`. Select the **Send** button and observe how Copilot generates a report page with relevant visuals and insights.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you see the error message **"Something went wrong"**, try refreshing the page and restart the task. Being in a shared environment, the service may be busy at times
    > - If Copilot needs additional context to understand your query, consider rephrasing your prompt to include more details.
    > - The responses from Copilot may not match the ones in the screenshot but will provide a similar outcome.

    Based on this report, we notice that the website bounce rate for Contoso is especially high amongst the Millennial customer segment. Let's ask Copilot if it has any recommendations for improving this bounce rate based on the results and data in the report.

13. Enter the following prompt in the chat interface: `Based on the data in the page, what can be done to improve the bounce rate of millennials?` and select the **Send** button.

14. Look at the suggestions Copilot provided. Copilot creates the desired Power BI report and even goes a step further to give powerful insights. Wendy realizes that for the website bounce rate to improve, Zava needs to transform their mobile website experience for millennials. This helps them reduce their millennial related customer churn too.

15. Now, what if Zava's leadership team needed a quick summary of this entire report? Narrative to the rescue!

16. Select the **Narrative** visual from the **Visualizations** pane to add it to the report canvas.

    ![Screenshot showing the narrative visual in Microsoft Fabric](/lab/media/narrative-visual.png)

17. Adjust and expand the **Narrative** visual to fit the report canvas, you can do this by replacing 1 or 2 visuals on the canvas with the **Narrative** visual.

18. Select the **Copilot (preview)** button within the visual. Then enter the following prompt: `Summarize the data, provide an executive summary, indicating important takeaways` and select the **Update** button.

    ![Screenshot showing how to update Narrative visual in Microsoft Fabric](/lab/media/narrative-update.png)

19. Select the **Close** icon denoted with an **X** in the pop-up window to exit the Narrative visual.

    See how easy it was to get an executive summary with absolutely no IT resource dependency! The summary could also be generated in another language, if specified. Additionally, the summary updates if you filter the report on any visual.

20. Select **File** from the menu bar, then select **Save this report** to save your report.
